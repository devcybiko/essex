# Essex Card Game

The project was built under Java 1.8. Despite being advised to do only a part of the project, it was so much fun that I finished it.

Note that there's no `main()` app as it wasn't required. But the `GameTest` junit demonstrates a full game execution.

## Running it
`mvn clean test site`
